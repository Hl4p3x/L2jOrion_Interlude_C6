<html><body>Master Gwain:<br>
So you have come here because you want to become a Trooper, eh? You should know that we only admit those who possess the right temperament and natural ability to learn our sophisticated skills.<br>
In short, you must pass a test to prove yourself to us. I can tell from your look that you are not yet experienced enough to even attempt the test...<br>
(Only male Kamael soldiers level 18 or higher may embark on this quest.)
