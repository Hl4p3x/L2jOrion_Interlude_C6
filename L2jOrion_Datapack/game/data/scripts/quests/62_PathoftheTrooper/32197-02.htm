Excellent! I like your boldness.<br>
The test itself is very simple. You must defeat a certain malignant spirit to prove 
your bravery and strength and bring back the creature's hear as proof. But no matter 
how talented you may be, a lack of experience will make you easy prey for this spirit.<br>
Therefore, before you begin the test, I advise you complete some additional training. 
Frankly, I am sick of seeing the young of our race die meaningless deaths after taking 
on this challenge equipped with nothing but courage.<br>
So go to Gludin Village, train under Master Shubain and bring back his letter of 
recommendation. Then we will discuss the details of the test.
