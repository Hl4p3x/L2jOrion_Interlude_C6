I have heard that you attained the level necessery to enter Nornil's Cave.<br>
If that is the case, I suppose the time is drawing near for you to leave this island. Well, they say that the continent is also filled with adventure.<br>
Before you leave, though, would you do me a small favor? I need something, but I can get it only by entering Nornil's Cave.<br>
All the friends who used to help me in this regard have left the island, so I am at loose ends...<br>
