If you have information or secrets they are interested in, they may try to find you first...<br>
Wait a minute -- let me check some information reported by the Steelrazor...<br>
Hmm... According to this, <font color="LEVEL">Dark Elven Magister Clayton in the 
Town of Dion</font> knows the important secret concerning our race...<br>
The secret group may be interested in this information.<br>
If you wish to join, perhaps a meeting with Clayton will help your chances.<br>
