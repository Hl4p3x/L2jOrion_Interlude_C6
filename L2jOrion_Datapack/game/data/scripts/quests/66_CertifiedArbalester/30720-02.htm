Ha!<br>
Gauen had the gall to say such things?!<br>
It is he who wished to keep the Giants' research documents.<br>
His greed and duplicity are almost unbelievable...<br>
He pretends to be an honorable man, bu the real Gauen is a myster.<br>
I swear that what we did, we did to prevent the documents from falling into the hands of Beleth.<br>
That was the perfect opportunity for Gauen to steal them himself and concoct 
this lame excuse.<br>
If he really had nothing to hide, why would he involve Manashen?<br>
