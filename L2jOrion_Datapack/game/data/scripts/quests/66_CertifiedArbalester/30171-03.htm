<html><body>Master Gaius:<br>
Well, one of the followers of that villain Beleth managed to obtain certain secrets about the Kamael.<br>
They were in a document that contained excertps of medical research conducted by the Giants.<br>
Our lord discovered that this information was passed to other followers of Beleth in Oren, 
then spread magically to other unknown places.<br>
The original spy is a high-ranking official in Giran, however, we simply did not have 
sufficient evidence to expose him as Beleth's follower...<br>
This situation was extremely urgent, and there simply was no other way for us 
to handle matters.<br>
I hope you understand...<br>
