Sorry!<br>
The Giants, I mean -- sometimes I lapse into my native tongue, which is somewhat more...poetic. 
The Giants were a great race who lived long, long ago.<br>
Through their science, they became almost the equal of the gods themselves.<br>
Our Dwarven skills, as well as many of the magic items of the other races, were 
strongly influenced by their legacy...<br>
