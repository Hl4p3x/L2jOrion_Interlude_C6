<html><body>Master Selsia:<br>
Welcome to Hunters Village. I received the message from Grand Master Meldina...<br>
As you know, we manage and protect information.<br>
This place may seem simple and unassuming, but spies from many different 
races exchange information, concoct plans and hatch conspiracies here...<br>
I think the village became such a nest of espionage because of its independence and 
isolated location, as well as certain events surrounding its establishment during the war.<br>
So be careful! Even the most ordinary-looking trader may be very different than he appears...<br>
We do cooperate with some of the other races' spies, but the alliances are never permanent.<br>
