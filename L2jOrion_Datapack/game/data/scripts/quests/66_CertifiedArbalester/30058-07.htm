<html><body>Warehouse Keeper Holvas:<br>
When I hold these pages up to the light, I can see hidden words here.<br>
Hmmm...<br>
These words are similar to the Kamael tongue, but they seem somehow older...<br>
Besides being written in a dead language, it also appears to be written in a code 
that I can't decipher...<br>
If you have studied under <font color="LEVEL">Kamael Grand master Meldina in 
Giran Castle Town</font>, you may be able to read it...<br>
Mmm... I will give you a copy of the code, just in case...<br>
In any event, thank you for your help.
