I heard that a Dwarven explorer discovered some records left by the Giants about your 
race at the Giants' Ruins.<br>
Unfortunately, both he and the records seem to have disappeared. Nobody knows if he is 
alive or dead...<br>
I heard this from my close friend <font color="LEVEL">Holvas</font>, so if you're 
interested in that book, I think you should ask him about it.<br>
I seem to remember him telling me that he might be able to get a copy... 
Why don't you go and see him?
