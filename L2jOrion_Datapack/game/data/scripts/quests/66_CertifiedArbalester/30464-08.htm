Ah, finally finished!<br>
My magical experiment is actually only a part of a much larger scheme designed to release 
the seal of our greatest elder.<br>
This elder has existed since ancient times, so he may also have been alive 
when your race was created...<br>
As far as I know, your race was relatively free from the influence of the gods 
on this continent -- what you call the Outer World.<br>
It is said that this was due to some unique feature of your race and its origin... 
I do not know any details beyond that.<br>
Perhaps the Dwarves possess more information -- they have held on to many of the 
ancient secrets in their quest to rediscover the Giants' science.<br>
Perhaps <font color="LEVEL">Blacksmith Poitan in the Town of Dion</font>, to whom this ingredient 
must be delivered, can tell you more.<br>
He is, after all, widely recognized as a scholar even among the Dwarves.<br>
Well? Would you like to meet him? If so, will you deliver this ingredient to him as well?<br>
