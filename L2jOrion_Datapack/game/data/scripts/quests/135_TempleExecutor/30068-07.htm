<html><body>Priest Shegfield:<br>
After the creation of the world, there was a great war between the gods, including Shilen and Einhasad. In the aftermath of this conflict, the Giants in their arrogance rebelled against Einhasad and inflicted grievous damage on the Celestial Realm before they were vanquished and their empire ground into dust.<br>
Then the Elves and Orcs went to war, and the destruction affected many other species. Finally, Humans emerged to rule this continent.<br>They did so only because of Einhasad's blessing.<br>
The first emperor of this united realm, Schuneimann, followed the instructions of Einhasad that he received from an angel with three wings. Thanks in part to his patronage, this Temple was established.<br>
Over time, Schuneimann's line became corrupted. Following the reign of the despotic Emperor Baium, the empire split into two separate regions: Elmore in the North and Aden in the South. The seeds of chaos planted in those days have darkly flowered now, to the point that even an unknown adventurer can set himself up as the lord of a castle. But our Temple has never lost sight of our heritage and continues to remain true to the path laid out all those years ago.<br>
