As you know, this village was built by poor peasants without any help from the nearby lord. People make their living by clearing land for farming, but without the military protection of the nobility, they are vulnerable to monster attacks. It has fallen to me to try to organize some sort of defense. In order to do so, I need funds to buy weapons and hire adventurers from the Temple.<br>
I have heard a rumor that the Delu Lizardmen hid a treasure near here, and that a map showing its location can be obtained by hunting <font color="LEVEL">Delu Lizardman Suppliers, Special Agents, Commanders, Shaman and Cursed Seers</font>.<br>
Would you be willing to get me <font color="LEVEL">10</font> <font color="LEVEL">Old Treasure Maps</font>? In exchange, I will write you the letter of reference you require.<br>

<a action="bypass -h Quest 135_TempleExecutor 30291-06.htm">Let Alex know you understand the problems of the townspeople and are ready to begin helping now.</a>
