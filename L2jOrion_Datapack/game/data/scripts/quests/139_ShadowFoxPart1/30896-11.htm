<html><body>Warehouse Keeper Mia:<br>
Our client wants us to find the secret contract between the Tasaba Lizardmen and Iason.<br>
...<br>
Listen carefully now...<br>
Go to the <font color="LEVEL">Field of Silence</font> and get rid of the <font color="LEVEL">Tasaba Lizardmen and Tasaba Lizardman Shaman</font> there. Once you have done so, you will be able to obtain <font color="LEVEL">both the pieces of the key to the Records Chest and the Records Chest itself</font>. I can make 1 key to the Records Chest if I have <font color="LEVEL">10 pieces of the key</font>.<br>
What we seek should be within the Records Chest itself.<br>
Now go bring me the Records Chest and the pieces of the key we need to open it!
