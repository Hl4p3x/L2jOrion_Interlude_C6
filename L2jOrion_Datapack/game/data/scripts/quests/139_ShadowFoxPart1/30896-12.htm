We need at least 10 pieces of the key and 1 Records Chest in order to find open it and find the evidence our client has asked for.<br>
Go to the <font color="LEVEL">Field of Silence</font> and get rid of the <font color="LEVEL">Tasaba Lizardmen and Tasaba Lizardman Shaman</font> there. Once you have done so, you will be able to obtain <font color="LEVEL">both the pieces of the key to the Records Chest and the Records Chest itself</font>.
