How much are you willing to pay?<br>
Hmm, you must be here on the orders of another...<br>
No matter. In order to obtain Stabilized Ectoplasm, I first require plain ectoplasm, which is itself a rare item.<br>
In fact, I have need of it as well...<br>
You have the look of an adventurer, so I will strike a bargain with you.<br>
Exterminate<font color="LEVEL"> the Mirror Ghost and the Mummy in the Forest of Mirrors</font> and you will be able to acquire<font color="LEVEL"> ectoplasms</font>.<br>
Thirty ectoplasms will produce one Stabilized Ectoplasm. Bring back<font color="LEVEL"> 35</font> of them and give me 5. Then I will make you a Stabilized Ectoplasm using the remainder.
