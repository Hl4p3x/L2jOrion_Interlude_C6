Have you come in search of the Resonace Amulet?<br>
I came upon it by chance while exploring some ancient ruins in the course of my research.<br>
I would like to help you, but my Resonance Amulet is currently installed as an activation device 
for a prototype weapon that I am developing.<br>
Since it is already completely synchronized, I'm afraid that it wouldn't be of any use to you.<br>
