The cell tissues that Justin needs are very fragile, and if they are less than perfect 
they are completely unusable.<br>
It is possible to transport them using a special low temperature treatment, but we will 
need icicles for the procedure.<br>
Bring me the icicles and I'll be able to complete the treatment.<br>
Ask Chef Jeremy in the Hot Springs region where to obtain icicles.
