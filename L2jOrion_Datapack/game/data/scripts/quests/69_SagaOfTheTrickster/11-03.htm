<html><body>Magister Alminas:<br>
After I obtained the Resonance Amulet, I examined it in some detail.<br>
While I do not know its exact composition, I do know that it was made from some material 
that Gran Kain cherished dearly.<br>
Halisha, one of the rulers of Hell, is said to use this very same material. Perhaps you 
could get it by defeating his Minions or Archon?<br>
Luckily, I have heard that Halisha is now sending many of his minions to the Four Sepulchers. If I 
were you, I would hurry there.<br>
Hmm... the evil creatures in the Shrine of Loyalty are also Minions of Halisha. Perhaps they also 
have the material you seek.<br>
Once you've obtained it, go to the Tablet in the southwest portion of the Wall of Argos.
