<html><body>Master Digler:<br>
To get the Resonance Amulet, there are two ways.<br>
One way is to defeat the <font color="LEVEL">Demon Halisha,</font> who is located within <font color="LEVEL">the Four Sepulchers.</font> 
you must form a party to enter.
If that proves too difficult, defeat the followers of Halisha at the <font color="LEVEL">Shrine of Loyalty.</font> By doing so, 
you can earn "tickets." Once you have acquired over <font color="LEVEL">700</font> tickets, Halisha himself will appear. By the way, 
the creatures you must face are the <font color="LEVEL">Grave Scarab, Scavenger Scarab, Grave Ant, Scavenger Ant, Shrine Knight and Stander.</font>
