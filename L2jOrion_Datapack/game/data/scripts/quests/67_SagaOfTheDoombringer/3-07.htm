In order to renew the power of the damaged amulet, we need the Divine Stone of Wisdom and its strong spiritual power.<br>
That stone is possessed by two great magicians: the Soul Guide Asefa of the Ketra Orcs and the Soul Guide Udan Mardui 
of the Varka Silenos.<br>
They will award the stone to the most intelligent ones among their kind. If you can gain eithers' trust and prove your 
worthiness, they will give you the stone.<br>
There is no other way than to obtain the Divine Stone of Wisdom other than from them. What will you do?<br>
