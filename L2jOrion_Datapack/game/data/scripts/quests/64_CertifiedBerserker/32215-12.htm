I already heard. Thank you.<br>
Meanwhile, we found another message plate left by the transportation team that revealed that they were 
moving towards the Plains of the Lizardmen. We hurriedly sent reinforcements, but they were destroyed 
after a fierce battle. The transportation unit was also largely destroyed, and Harkilgamed seems to be 
in hiding with the item somewhere near the Plains of the Lizardmen.<br>
Your mission is to go the Plains of the Lizardmen, defeat our enemies and rescue Harkilgamed.
