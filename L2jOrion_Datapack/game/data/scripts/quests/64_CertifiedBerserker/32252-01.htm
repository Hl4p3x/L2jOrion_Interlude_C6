Did Tenain send you? Not a moment too soon! We are in serious trouble here. While transporting the goods, 
our convoy was attacked -- they seemed to know exactly who and where we were. I was knocked unconscious 
during the battle, I regret to say, so I don't know what happened... When I awoke, everyone was gone. 
But I know that Harkilgamed would not let them take the item without a fight...<br>
Members of the Berserker Guild are trained to leave a secret message in an event like this for the next team 
-- we should search the area at once!<br>
