<html><body>Master Entien:<br>
You came here after receiving my message? You came to right place! As you know, some of the thieves who attacked 
our wagon have scattered to notify their superiors of the cargo's destination. You must prevent 
them from doing so!<br>
According to the report I received from a guild member, the thieves have disguised themselves as monsters and scattered 
in all directions. I will track those who went south and west; you must find those thieves who went east 
and north. <font color="LEVEL">The thief who went east is disguised as a Dead Seeker of Execution Grounds, 
while the one who went north is disguised as a Marsh Stakato Drone from the Cruma Marshlands.
</font> Find them, slay them and return to me!
