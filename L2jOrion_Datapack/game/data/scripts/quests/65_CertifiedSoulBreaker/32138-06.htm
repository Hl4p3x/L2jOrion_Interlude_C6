<html><body>Hierarch Kekropus:<br>
You must have felt that the magic we use is of a fundamentally different form than the magic used by the other races. Our power is channelled not through songs or gestures, but through a distinct source. To tap into it, you must be able to feel and control the magical power within you -- that is the purpose of this ceremony. We will need a specific ingredient to begin, however. Below Dragon Valley, in the Gorgon's Garden, you will find a Worm who has been weaked by the effects of the Land Dragon Antharas. He still harbors certain magic we need. Bring me 10 of the Worm's hearts.
