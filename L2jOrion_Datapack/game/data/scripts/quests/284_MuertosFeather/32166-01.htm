Hmm, my keen intuition tells me that good things are in store both of us. Curious? Well, let me offer you the chance to take advantage of a terrific opportunity. Muertos feathers have become more and more popular, and their price is soaring. But the Muertos in this area are known to be fierce and refuse to give up their feathers easily. It has become increasingly difficult to find a courageous adventurer willing to obtain even a small sampling of those feathers -- despite the profit that can be had.<br>
How about you? Would you do it? I'm sure it would help hone your skills as well as protect the good people of this area. A real win-win!<br>
