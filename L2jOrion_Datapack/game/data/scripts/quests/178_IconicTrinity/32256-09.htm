N: I assume you have heard of it as well? Though it is no longer the case, this Isle of Souls was once sealed, hidden between dimensions...<br>
Why do you suppose it was sealed? The other races believe that it was because of the Kamael's exceptional combat abilities, but do you really think a dimensional seal was necessary for just that reason? Hiding an island of this size between dimensions would have been almost impossible even for the combined strength hundreds -- even thousands -- of the best magicians on the continent.<br>
