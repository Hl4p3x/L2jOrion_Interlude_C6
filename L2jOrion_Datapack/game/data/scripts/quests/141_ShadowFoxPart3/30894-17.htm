They respect diversity...<br>
They claim that all powers and creatures are equal, and that the Temple and the Rulers of Dawn are simply trying to accumulate power and wealth for their own benefit.<br>
The Preachers and the Revolutionaries of Dusk say that their opponents are hypocrites and liars intent on using religion to exploit the people...<br>
They believe that true peace can only be achieved by respecting diversity of race, culture and belief. The use of force, they say, will only create a tyrannical artificial peace.<br>

The Temple and the Rulers of Dawn have perpetuated that myth, they say, to maintain their hold on power.<br>
Both the Preachers and the Revolutionaries of Dusk are intent on finding iron-clad evidence of the Temple's hypocrisy that will sway the people to their side.<br>
