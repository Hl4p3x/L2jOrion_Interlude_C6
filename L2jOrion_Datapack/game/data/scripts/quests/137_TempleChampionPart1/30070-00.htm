<html><body>High Priest Sylvain:<br>
You are neither the Hands nor the Feet of the Temple of Einhasad....<br>
I'm a bit uncomfortable entrusting you with an important mission for the Temple.<br>
There is some classified information about the Temple involved here, you see... Please understand...<br>
You may ask Priest Shegfield about becoming the Hands of the Temple, and you can speak with Priest Glyvka about becoming the Feet of the Temple...<br>
(Only characters who have completed the Feet of the Temple and Hands of the Temple quests are permitted to take on this quest.)
