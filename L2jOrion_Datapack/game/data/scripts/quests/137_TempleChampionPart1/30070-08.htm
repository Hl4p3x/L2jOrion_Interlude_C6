<html><body>High Priest Sylvain:<br>
Many of our regional temples have recently reported certain signs and omens that we cannot ignore...<br>
We dispatched an inspector to investigate, but apparently something befell his party near the Execution Grounds.<br>
He was carrying the final report on his discoveries when, we suspect, he and his companions were attacked.<br><br>
Defeat monsters at the Execution Grounds -- <font color="LEVEL">Amber Basilisks, Strains, Ghouls, Granite Golems, Dead Seekers and Hangman Trees</font> -- and bring me the <font color="LEVEL">pieces of the inspector's report</font>.<br>
It should be approximately <font color="LEVEL">30 pages</font> altogether...
