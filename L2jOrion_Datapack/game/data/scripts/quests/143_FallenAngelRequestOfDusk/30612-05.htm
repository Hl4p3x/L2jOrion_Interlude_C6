Perhaps you are -- now.<br>
But your encounter with the angel may change you...<br>
Because the strong grow stronger and the weak become weaker, this world is waiting for a hero who is unafraid to speak truth to power and who will face the coming darkness without flinching.<br>
Whether that is you, I cannot say. But I pray that that person appears soon -- for all our sakes.<br>
