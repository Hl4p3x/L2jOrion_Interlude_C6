<html><body>Grand Master Tobias:<br>
Both the Preachers of the Wilderness and the Revolutioneries of Dusk heard the sounds of the angel asking for aid...<br>
Apparently he was injurned and being pursued by something very powerful.<br>
Now that u know where he is, the first thing to do is to heal him.<br>
Elder Casian is <font color="LEVEL">somewhere in the wilderness</font> -- his medicine can heal the angel.<br>
Find him and obtain the medicine.<br>
If you give him the Prophecy, he can tell you the Angel's exact location.<br>
Then u must heal the angel and place his message within this empty Echo Crystal...<br>
Casian will give you the details.
