The seed of chaos planted in your very being is what allows you to live according to your own will than being the clave of fate.<br>
That is freedom indeed...<br>
Your will cannot be manipulated nor controlled; it rebels against the old order.<br>
Liberate it and you will be free of the shackles of fate. Perhaps then you will be able to forge a new path...<br>
