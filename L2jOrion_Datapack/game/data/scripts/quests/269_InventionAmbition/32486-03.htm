Thank you so much! That will be very helpful! Let me tell you about the materials I need. <br>
They are called <fontcolor="LEVEL">"Energy Ore"</font>.<br>
Fortunately, you can easily acquire them by hunting the monsters in the <font color="LEVEL">Eastern Mining Zone</font> to the north of the Dwarven Village. <br>
Let's see, the monsters there are mostly <font color="LEVEL">"Red Eye Barbed Bats, Northern Trimden, Kerop Werewolves, Kerop Werewolf Chiefs, Northern Goblins, Northern Goblin Leaders, Spine Golems and Enchanted Spine Golems."</font> Those are the monsters you'll have to face. Understand? <br>
Now, please gather as many Energy Ore as possible. Ah! I am far too busy! Too busy! I need to hurry up and review the blueprint. Good luck!
