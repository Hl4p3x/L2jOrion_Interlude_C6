<body>Buzz the Cat:<br>
Nice to meet you! I'm Buzz the Cat, faithful employee to Gardener Fordson of Floran. My boss is one of the greatest agricultural geniuses in all of Aden. After such a successful Summer, Gardener Fordson has reinvested in a new lot of improved magical squash seeds. He has decided to grow them for the Fall season. Fortunately for you, we still have more seeds than we know what to do with. We would love more nectar to develop full grown squashes to meet our increased customer demands.<br>
Would you like to help me out? <br> I will trade you seeds for nectar.  You can get nectar by killing any monsters near your level all throughout the world.<br>

Plant the seed by double-clicking on it! Raise it well and claim your prizes! Good luck!  <br>Ah, and be careful when you smash a squash.  You should only do it in open and level ground! <font color="LEVEL">If the items that explode out of a squash end up on a roof or other high place, nobody can pick them up!</font><br>Squash grow by taking in nectar. After planting a seed, drip nectar on it and it will grow quickly! After taking enough nectar, the squash will evolve. If you hit it with a weapon, the squash will crack open! Be careful, there are several things you should look out for.<br><font color="LEVEL">First of all, if you hit it before it's fully grown,</font> it will wilt from lack of nutrition. Also, since <font color="LEVEL">a squash tends to flee</font>, you should try to crack it open before it gets out of hand! <font color="LEVEL">Also, a large squash can't be opened with a regular weapon!  </font> I heard that there are <font color="LEVEL">chrono weapons</font> that produce musical sounds when you hit it against something.  You will only be able to hit large squash with weapons of this type.  <br1><font color="LEVEL">One last thing!  Since it's not easy to open a large squash by yourself,</font> you should find a friend who can help you open it.  <br>Do you understand everything I've told you?<br>
