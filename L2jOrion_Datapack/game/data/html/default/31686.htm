<HTML><BODY>Gatekeeper of the Fire Dragon:<BR>
Congratulations on making it this far! I'm sorry, but this door can only be opened by the gatekeeper of the fire dragon on the other side of the crossroads you just passed. The door I control is behind him.<BR>
If you made it this far, you should be alright. Remember, if you have a companion, you can open both doors simultaneously.<BR>
