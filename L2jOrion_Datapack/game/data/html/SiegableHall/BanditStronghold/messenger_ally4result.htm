Let me tell you what my opinion is regarding the Oel Mahum Clerics... Ah, even Oel Mahums have a god they worship. It is not the same god called Ein... something that you guys believe in. But, having a god for themselves won't change their natural temperament, will it? They would rather kill than eat. Whenever they get into a fight, they fret themselves to death while trying to blow their enemies' heads off. If an oel mahum feels threatened he will not hesitate to run away and heal himself.... They are the kind of people who always leave a bad taste in your mouth.
