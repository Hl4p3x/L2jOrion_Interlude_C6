Kookaburras are quite rare. They possess unusually long legs and brilliantly-colored feathers... They peck the enemy with their beaks and use a mysterious and extremely powerful magic. They don't respond well to beatings. The only reason I was able to capture them is their susceptibility to magic.<br>
