Have you ever played a high stakes event? If so, you'll understand quickly. Once you enter the arena, my good friend, the Game Coordinator, will provide instructions on how the game is played. He will then call out some words, which you must spell by breaking the treasure boxes in the four circles. Combine the letters you find into words, and take them to the Coordinator! You will then get an item for use in the game!<br>
You can use this item against the Coordinator, depending on the situation. You may hit a jackpot or impede others, or sometimes my jerk friend...ehh... Well, you'll find out soon enough.<br>
Oh, I almost forgot the most important thing! The only way to open the Treasure Boxes is by hitting them with your <font color="LEVEL">bare hands</font>. Don't forget!<br>
