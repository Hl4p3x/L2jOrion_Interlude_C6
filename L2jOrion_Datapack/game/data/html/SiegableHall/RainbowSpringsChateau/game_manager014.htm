To participate in the game, you must abide by the rules. I'm afraid that I must deny your entry because you do not meet the following requirement:<br>
Participation - <font color="LEVEL">You must have a party of at least 5 clan members with a clan leader as the leader of the party.</font><br><br>
Have you registered for the game?<br><br>
