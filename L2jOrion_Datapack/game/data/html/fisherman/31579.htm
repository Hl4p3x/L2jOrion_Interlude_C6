<html><body>Fishing Guild Member Klaus:<br>
I'm Klaus, a member of the Fishermen's Guild. I'm the fishing specialist in these parts!<br>
The region of Goddard is very mountainous and has many lakes brimming with high-quality fish! Skilled fishermen come here seeking diversity and a challange. Some even fish in the host springs to the north!<br>
