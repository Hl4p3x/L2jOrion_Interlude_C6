<html><body>Fishing Guild Member Willie:<br>
Much like the Ivory Tower, Oren has long been a magnet for the intelligentsia! Therefore, many folks here enjoy fishing in their free time! You'll often find them sitting quietly at their favorite fishing spot, engrossed in their thoughts, waiting for a fish to bite. Some are so engrossed in their daydreams that after a few hours they end up not catching anything at all!<br>
