	/**
	 * ONE of the drops in this category is to be dropped now. to see which one will be dropped, weight all items' chances such that their sum of chances equals MAX_CHANCE. since the individual drops have their base chance, we also ought to use the base category chance for the weight. So weight =
	 * MAX_CHANCE/basecategoryDropChance. Then get a single random number within this range. The first item (in order of the list) whose contribution to the sum makes the sum greater than the random number, will be dropped. Edited: How _categoryBalancedChance works in high rate servers: Let's say
	 * item1 has a drop chance (when considered alone, without category) of 1 % * RATE_DROP_ITEMS and item2 has 20 % * RATE_DROP_ITEMS, and the server's RATE_DROP_ITEMS is for example 50x. Without this balancer, the relative chance inside the category to select item1 to be dropped would be 1/26 and
	 * item2 25/26, no matter what rates are used. In high rate servers people usually consider the 1 % individual drop chance should become higher than this relative chance (1/26) inside the category, since having the both items for example in their own categories would result in having a drop
	 * chance for item1 50 % and item2 1000 %. _categoryBalancedChance limits the individual chances to 100 % max, making the chance for item1 to be selected from this category 50/(50+100) = 1/3 and item2 100/150 = 2/3. This change doesn't affect calculation when drop_chance * RATE_DROP_ITEMS < 100
	 * %, meaning there are no big changes for low rate servers and no changes at all for 1x servers.
	 * @param raid
	 * @return selected drop from category, or null if nothing is dropped.
